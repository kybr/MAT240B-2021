# Native File Dialogs



Run `get-and-build-native-file-dialog` from the command line from within this directory. This should add two files, `libnfd.a` and `nfd.h`. Using the `flags.cmake` scheme, this will allow us to build AlloLib apps against the <https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog> library.
